## What we Learned
We learned a great deal about the complexities of diabetes management and how personalized nutrition can play a vital role. On the technical side, we gained experience in integrating multiple backend technologies and handling sensitive health-related data.

## What's Next for DiaBites
The next step for DiaBites is to expand its scope beyond diabetes by incorporating meal plans for other health conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. We also aim to support more dietary preferences and expand our recipe database for broader customization options. We also aim to integrate an AI powered chatbot that can conviently answer any questions related to nutrition for users to access. We also plan on moving to a mobile app so users can receive notifications close to meal times and ample times to take their insulin.
